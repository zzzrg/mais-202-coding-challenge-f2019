Loans are an extremely powerful financial instrument; they have the potential to create opportunities and foster growth.
To learn more about loans and what influences them, we have provided you with two csv's: *loan_data.csv* and *home_ownership_data.csv*.

*loan_data.csv* contains information about loans such as their interest rate, purpose, length, grade, and amount in a comma seperated format as shown below.

*home_ownership_data.csv* contains information about home ownership for each `member_id` in the *loan_data.csv* file, as shown below.

## Instructions

Your challenge will be as follows:

1. Make a copy of this repository on your own personal github account (you can fork or download it). 

2. Write a python script which loads the datasets, parses the information, and determines the average loan amount for each of the
home ownership statuses.

3. Plot the results onto a graph.

## Sample Results

The output of your script should be similar to the results shown below.

</div>

## Submission Instructions

All your source code should be pushed to the personal repository which you have created in step 1, along with any necessary documentation explaining how to run your script.

The url to the repository should be included in your application and made public by **11:59 pm, September 10th, 2019** in order for it to be evaluated. If you have any questions regarding this challenge, please reach out to us through our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/McGillAI/).
